# Week10_Portfolio-Programming
This assignment is made up of two components. The first component is using the project you have been building upon up till and including week 8. This is a cumulative submission and should include all aspects of previous assignments, including classes, functions, modules, database functionality, reading/writing to files, and error handling. Pay special attention to good formatting and efficient code logic. Ensure you make all necessary updates and enhancements based on assignment feedback received throughout the course.

In addition, you will add functionality to your code. The choice of functionality is up to you, and below are some options. By adding this functionality, you will be making your application unique. If you choose to use a tool not covered in class, you will have to consult the library documentation.

Some of the addition options include, but are not limited to:

Using a graphing library other than matplotlib
Use matplotlib finance API to add to the graphs you created, perhaps by examining the price movements in the dataset (matplotlib Links to an external site.)
Produce a graph or a chart depicting different information than what you have done in previous assignment with any library
Explore Tkinter and create a basic interface for your application, allowing users to choose data input file paths for example (tkinter Links to an external site.)
Use Pandas to perform some analysis not applied in the Data Analytics Applied to the Stock Problem Discussion
Use an Python API such as from Yahoo Finance (Yahoo Finance Links to an external site.), to obtain more data (for example a more recent stock price) (Textbook chapter 17 will give you an idea of how APIs work, in addition to the API documentation)
To receive full credit, post your code on GitHub and provide the instructor with the information necessary to access it, in addition to posting your code to Canvas, like you have previous assignments.

The second component of the final assignment is a reflection:

Reflect on your Portfolio Assignment â€“ are there areas you would like to still improve it in?
Describe the updates you included in your work based on the instructor feedback given in previous submissions.
Are there areas you would like to still improve it in?
Can you think of other functionality that would be beneficial?
What was your experience implementing the new functionality?
Was the functionality hard to implement?
Was the documentation easy or difficult to find?
Was the documentation difficult to interpret?
Show screenshots of your added functionality at work.
